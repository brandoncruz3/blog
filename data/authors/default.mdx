I’m a Staff DevOps Engineer with over 17 years of experience designing, building, and maintaining enterprise-scale software systems and infrastructure. My career has spanned full-stack engineering, cloud architecture, and infrastructure automation, with a strong focus on scalable, secure, and resilient solutions.

I specialize in AWS, Kubernetes (EKS), Terraform, and automation pipelines, and I love working across the full stack—from backend services in Go, Python, and Ruby to frontend applications built with React. I’ve led major multi-account AWS migrations for Healthcare.gov and Medicare.gov, helped shape DevSecOps culture at Ad Hoc, and championed practices like blameless postmortems, chaos engineering, and observability improvements using Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki.

Lately, I’ve been focused on building self-service DevOps platforms, optimizing CI/CD workflows, and empowering teams with automation that scales. I bring a practical, systems-thinking approach to solving tough engineering problems and driving reliability across organizations.

Outside of work, you’ll usually find me coaching youth baseball, football, and basketball, or deep in a fantasy sports league. I’m a die-hard fan of the Las Vegas Raiders, Los Angeles Dodgers, Sacramento Kings, and Las Vegas Golden Knights — and I’m just as passionate about building great systems in the cloud as I am about building great teams on the field.
