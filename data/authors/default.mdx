I’m a Staff DevOps Engineer with over 17 years of experience designing, developing, and maintaining complex software systems and infrastructure.

My career has spanned full-stack engineering, cloud architecture, and infrastructure automation, with a strong focus on scalable, secure, and resilient solutions.

I’ve led major migrations—including multi-account AWS reorganizations for Healthcare.gov and Medicare.gov—and helped cultivate DevSecOps practices across cross-functional teams.

My toolkit includes AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, Go, and observability stacks like Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki.

Whether it’s optimizing CI/CD pipelines, building self-service developer platforms, or leading blameless postmortems, I bring a practical, systems-thinking approach to solving tough engineering problems.

When I’m not working, I coach youth sports, tinker with side projects, and avid fan of the Las Vegas Raiders, Los Angeles Dodgers, Sacramento Kings, and Las Vegas Golden Knights.
